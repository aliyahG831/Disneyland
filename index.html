  <h2> 
  The Food 
</h2>

  <body2>
  <a> 
    The food at Disneyland has to be one of the best parts about the park because its delicious. ðŸ˜‹ 
    <p> 
       My favorite food and snack to eat at Disneyland would be the pickles and churros. Personally I did think the macaroni at Galaxy's Edge was good but the chicken felt very worked on. As if they added a lot of steroids to it. So I'd give it a 5/10. One thing I would say is the best dining experience would be the Character dining. I have gone multiple times and I always enjoyed it. The food is good too. I would say that the breakfast is better though because their waffles are delicious.

    Down below I have added a link to a website that provides good food recomondations to eat at both parks.

    <h3> 
      The Rides
   </h3> 
    <p>
      For the sake of space I will only be talking about rides from Magic Kingdom. The rides in Magic Kingdom are classics but also most of them are kind of boring. Don't get me wrong not all of them are boring but I would say the ones in Fantasyland are. EXCEPT the tea cup ride, that is the only exception. I would say the worst ride in Fantasyland, actually the worst ride in the park, is the <i>Matterhorn Bobsleds</i>. That ride is straight up traumatizing. Everything about that ride is terrible, the painful seats, you get wet like c'mon, and the scary a** yeti animatronic. I will never get on that ride ever again.

    <h4>
      The Parks 
    </h4>
    <p>
      Not only is there Magic Kingdom but, there's also California Adventure (which I'd say is much more superior than MK). Both parks are fun but when going into the fundamentals of a theme park fit for a teenager, I'd say CA is the best choice.California has faster and more exciting rides like the <i>Incredicoaster</i>,<i> CARS </i>, and <i> Guardians Of the Galaxy</i>.
